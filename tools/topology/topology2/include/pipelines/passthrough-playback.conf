# Volume playback pipeline
#
# A simple pipeline. All attributes defined herein are namespaced by alsatplg to
# "Object.Pipeline.passthrough-playback.N.attribute_name"
#
# Usage: this component can be used by declaring in the top-level topology conf file as follows:
#
# 	Object.passthrough-playback."N" {
#		format		"s16le"
#		period		1000
#		time_domain	"timer"
#		channels	2
#		rate		48000
#	}
#
# and N is the unique pipeline_id for this pipeline object within the same alsaconf node.
#
#
# (sink) host.N.playback -> buffer.N.1 (source endpoint)
#

		#
		# passthrough-playback pipeline objects instantiated within the same alsaconf node must have

		unique	"index"
